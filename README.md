SCD, a genetic disorder, needs early diagnosis; traditional methods slow/variable. AI system uses transfer learning (ShuffleNetV2, MobileNetV2, InceptionNet, ResNet50) on blood smears for rapid detection. ResNet50: 87.28% accuracy, reduces errors. LIME/Grad-CAM confirm key feature focus, boosting clinical potential.
